1. SSL/TLS Certificates.
-----------------------------
In two ways we can generate SSL OR TLS Certificates.

#AWS Certificate Manager (ACM):public certificates are free in aws.
-----------------------------
*Go to ACM service their request for public certificate
   1.ask for domain give the both naked(awsaparna123.xyz) and wildcard(*.awsaparna123.xyz) domain details.
   2.validation method:either DNS validation or Email address.we will go with DNS validation
   3.Key alogorithm:RSA 2048
   4.click request
*it will show pending validation if you create CNAME record in Route 53 service then only it will show the validation is success in status.

*go to Route 53 service and create a record configure those details like CNAME,value which is ACM.Generate two records for naked and wildcard.
   
#3rd party certs using Certbot & Import in to AWS Certificate Manager.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
*create an ubuntu machine and log into machine.
*install certbot and genearte both naked and wild card certificate and key.
     
sudo snap install --classic certbot

Wildcard Domain:
---------------
certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges=dns --key-type rsa --email aparnassana2001@gmail.com \
--server https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory --agree-tos -d *.awsaparna123.xyz

Naked Domain:
-------------
certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges=dns --key-type rsa --email aparnassana2001@gmail.com \
--server https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory --agree-tos -d awsaparna123.xyz

  or 
  
naked domain command to generate certificate and key:
certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges=dns --key-type rsa --email aparnassana2001@gmail.com --agree-tos -d awsaparna123.xyz

wildcard domain command to generate certificate and key:
certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges=dns --key-type rsa --email aparnassana2001@gmail.com --agree-tos -d *.awsaparna123.xyz

output:u will get below location print that using cat u will get encrypted code
/etc/letsencrypt/live/awsaparna123.xyz/fullchain.pem
/etc/letsencrypt/live/awsaparna123.xyz/privkey.pem

*go to vscode and create like naked-awsaparna123.xyz.crt,naked-awsaparna123.xyz.key,wildcard-awsaparna123.xyz.crt,wildcard-awsaparna123.xyz.crt. copy those encrypted code and paste it in these files privkey.pem-->in naked-awsaparna123.xyz.key,fullchain.pem-->
naked-awsaparna123.xyz.crt.Repeat this process for wildcard also.


*import that certicate in ACM .Go to ACM service their import certificate is there paste these files pem details and import .Do this for both naked and wildcard.
