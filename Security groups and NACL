Inbound Traffic -> Outside to Inside

Outbound Traffic -> Inside to Outside

Statefull Firewall If you allow inbound/outbound traffic, no need to open the ports for response traffic. AWS SG falls under Statefull firewall.

Stateless Firewall Its required to allowing both inbound and outbound and also ports for response traffic for Stateless Firewall. AWS NACL falls under it.


1.what is the difference between NACL and Security Groups?

sg:
*security group is an statefull firewall
*AWS SG is applied to all resources like EC2,RDS,Lambda,load balancer etc except subnets.
*security groups dont have option "deny" by default all the traffic is deny and you need to allow the souce ip address in security groups.	


nacl:
*nacl is an stateless firewall
*Network access control list(NACL) - Stateless firewall and applicable to subnets only.when we create subnet by default nacl firewall is created.
*In nacl we have both allow and deny which ever rule have lower it is basically allowed.



note:
*For single server we can assign 5 security groups.(with maximum of 5 sgs per network interface).
*linux Dynamic ports or ephemeral ports  -->49152â€“65535
*for single nacl default we can add upto 20 rules 
*for single security groups we can add upto 60 rules.
