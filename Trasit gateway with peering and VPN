Transit Gateway:
--------------------

*Trasit Gateway will act as central hub or router,with the help of trasnit gateway we can do vpc peering.
*Using AWS transit gateway we connect the on prem to cloud with the help of vpn.

Task:
----
1.Create three vpcs in aws and deploy an nginx server in three vpcs in their subnets.
  vpc1-->10.63.0.0/16,vpc1-subnet-->10.63.1.0/24,vpc1-windows-server-->10.63.1.35
  vpc2-->10.64.0.0/16,vpc2-subnet-->10.64.1.0/24,vpc2-windows-server-->10.64.1.107
  vpc3-->10.65.0.0/16,vpc3-subnet-->10.65.1.0/24,vpc3-windows server-->10.65.1.183
  
2.Create an Trasit Gateway by giving name AWSB65-TGW

3.Create a customer gateway by adding the VNG public ip of azure with name cgw1. 

3.After Trasit gateway is created we have to create attachments for vpc's so go to trasit gateway attachments and click create by giving the following details

VPN-ATTACHMENT:
---------------
name:VPN-ATTACHMENT
Transit gateway ID: give the id of AWSB65-TGW
Attachment type:VPN
Customer Gateway:Existing
Customer Gateway ID:cgw1 id
Routing options:static 
click create trasit gateway attachment

63-ATTACH:
------------
name:63-ATTACH
Transit gateway ID: give the id of AWSB65-TGW
Attachment type:VPC
VPC ID: give the id of vpc1
Subnet ID:vpc1-subnet
click create an transit gateway attachment


64-ATTACH:
------------
name:64-ATTACH
Transit gateway ID: give the id of AWSB65-TGW
Attachment type:VPC
VPC ID: give the id of vpc2
Subnet ID:vpc2-subnet
click create an transit gateway attachment


65-ATTACH:
------------
name:65-ATTACH
Transit gateway ID: give the id of AWSB65-TGW
Attachment type:VPC
VPC ID: give the id of vpc3
Subnet ID:vpc3-subnet
click create an transit gateway attachment


*go to transit gateway route tables where when you create an trasit gateway on that time one deafult route table is created.select that one check propagations is configured or not and add entries in routes then only you can able to communicate among vpc's.


Do this process in remmina:
---------------------------
*login to vpc1-windows-server and open powershell test it 
 > ping 10.64.1.107    
 
 > ping 10.65.1.183
 
*login to vpc2-windows-server and open powershell test it
 > ping 10.63.1.35    
 
 > ping 10.65.1.183
 
*login to vpc3-windows-server and open powershell test it
 > ping 10.63.1.35   
 
 > ping 10.64.1.107  -->it wont work so you have to update the route table
 
*go to vpc1 route table edit routes
  # destination-->10.64.0.0/16,target->trasit gateway id
  # destination-->10.65.0.0/16,target->trasit gateway id
  # destination-->192.168.0.0/16,target->trasit gateway id   -->this is azure vpc range
  click save

*go to vpc2 route table edit routes
  # destination-->10.63.0.0/16,target->trasit gateway id
  # destination-->10.65.0.0/16,target->trasit gateway id
  # destination-->192.168.0.0/16,target->trasit gateway id 
  click save
  
*go to vpc3 route table edit routes
  # destination-->10.63.0.0/16,target->trasit gateway id
  # destination-->10.64.0.0/16,target->trasit gateway id
  # destination-->192.168.0.0/16,target->trasit gateway id 
  click save
 

  
Azure:
-----
*creating an resource group with name "AWSB65"
*creating an virtual network(VNET) with name VNET1,region EastUS and range 192.168.0.0/16 and subnet with range 192.168.1.0/24
*After VNET1 is created, click on VNET1 and go to subnets and add an Gateway subnet with starting address: 192.168.10.0     -->whatever ips range we gave in gateway network.this ip addresses ranges will be used by virtual Network Gateway(VPG means VPN)  while creating the VPG
*Go to Virtual network gateways and create an vitual network gateway with configuring the below details and click review and create and then create.                 -->It will take sometime like 15 to 20 mins to deploy it.
  name:VNG1
  Region:EastUS
  Gateway type:VPN
  SKU:VpnGw1
  Generation:Generation1
  virtual network:VNET1
  public ip address:create new
  public ip address name:VNG1-PIP1
  Enable active-active mode:Disabled
  
  
*Create an windows virtual machine  with below configuration details
  resource group:AWSB65
  name:WINSVR1
  region:East US
  image:Windows server 2022 datacenter-Azure Edition -x64 Gen2
  Administrator account: give username and password of azure account.
  select inbound ports:RDP(3389)
  disks-->os disk type:Standard SSD
  Networking-->virtaul netowrk:VNET,Subnet:default(192.168.1.0/24)
  public ip: (new)AZWINSVR1-ip
  Click management,monitoring and then review and create and click create
  
  
  
*go to aws vpc service--open VPN connections--click on it -->in tunnel details it will have two ip addresses copy it in notepad.thier we have download configuration file give click on it and give details vendor:Cisco Systems,Inc. platform ISR Series Routers and then click on Download and save it in your local system.open that file you will have ip adress and key in line 53 and line 200 note down in note pad .see below
    line 53 --> pre-shared-key address 35.171.132.223 key 1RIfLypDvx42jrVS.L1Kl5br1czMwv16
    line 200---> pre-shared-key address 50.19.121.32 key IH8cjtZ.kPj.rO5W55crpw8Qzpsy7Z79
    
  
*Go to azure and go to local network gateways(is like customer gateways in aws,we will configure the aws vpn connections details in azure).

*create local network gateways by configuring the below details.(these details are which we have download configuration file)

*Go to VNG1 and click connection and create the connections by giving the follwing configurations (for two tunnels of our AWS-TO-AZURE) connection.One connection is enough but we have two tunnels details for testing purposes creating two conections.
  Tunnel1: if tunnel one id deployed then create tunnel 2 connection

    click review and create and click create          --->both tunnels should be up	
    
    
go to remmina:
-------------
*login into azure server using azure ip
*open powershell and run the commands
> ping 10.63.1.35
> ping 10.64.1.107
> ping 10.65.1.183



note:
-----
*Eventhough if you update route tables in aws for three vpcs and if u get tunnel1 and tunnel2 up also still the communication from aws to azure won't work until unless you updated the entry on routes in trasit gateway route table.

*go to trasit gateway route table-->create an static route for vpn connection by givimg 192.168.0.0/16 and VPN-ATTACHMENT id and then click create.so it will take time beacause the routes have to be work and if you ping each other from aws to azure.It will work
  	
*By default in trasit gateway route table vpc attchments are added in routes and for vpn attachment we are update the routes.


**if you want you can share the trsit gateway to another aws account.Using Resource Acess Manger service in aws.we can share our trasit gateway to other accounts so for that we have to create a resource share by configuring the trasit gateway id and aws account id details.
