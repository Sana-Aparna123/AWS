Firewall:
-------------

AWS Network Firewall will inspects the network traffic or vpc traffic.Filtering the traffic or restrict unauthorized request.

rule group format:
1.standard stateful group
2.Domain list
3.Suricata compatible rule string


task:
-------

*create an vpc with two subnets like firewall subnet and protected subnet.
*firewall rule groups:create statefull rule groups for both domain rule group and standard port groups 
1.domain rule group -->where we give the domains which domains we want to access from our windows instance
2.standard-port group -->add the four rules 
*tcp protocol source:my ip  and destination:protected subnet instance ip -->port 3389
*ssh protocol source:my ip and destination:protected subnet instance ip -->port 22
*HTTP protocol source:any  and destination:protected subnet instance ip -->port 22
*TCP protocol source:protected subnet instance ip -->port 80   if you give this then only your vm can communicate to internet when acess the domains in your vm browser.

*create an firewall policy and attching the both domain rule group and standard-port group

*create an firewall by adding the vpc,firewall subnet and existing firewall policy.

*after firewall is created.update the route table of protected subnet-->with  add 0.0.0.0/0 to Firewall vpce eni interface like eni-07327ef76d9a5401d and  For Firewall Subnet add 0.0.0.0/0 to IGW which is a public subnet.

*For IGWIngressSubnetRT, select EdgeAssosiattions and select IGW.In the same routing table, select routes, in the destination provide CIDR range of ProtectedSubnet and give target as Firewall vpce eni eni-07327ef76d9a5401d.

*login to your windows instance which is in protected subnet.go to browser and search for domains you have allowed in domain rule group.

note:
*using routing table send traffic to firewall.
*if firewall is deployed automatically firewall enpoint is created in firewall subnet(public subnet). firewall enpoint is like interface endpoint it will show the vpce-id in your route table target selection.  




firewall rule groups:create statefull rule groups
1.domain rule group
2.standard-port group

firewall policies:what rule groups has to be used we define in firewall policies.(add stateful rule groups)
*create an firewall policy add an domain rule group and standard port group

firewall:
------
*create an firewall by attching the firewall policy.
