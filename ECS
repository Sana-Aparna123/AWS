AWS Elastic Container Service(ECS)
----------------------------------
we have to categories 
1.EC2  -->Customer must manage the EC2 instances.
2.Fargate -->We will run images directlywithout any infrastructure(Serverless).

*Task definitions--->defining how much memory,cpu and what images these detailsin task definitions

process:
---------
*Go to ECS servive and deploy a cluster with t3.small instance type and 3 instances.

*create an task definition with below json code.

    {
  "requiresCompatibilities": [
    "EC2"
  ],
  "containerDefinitions": [
    {
      "name": "fastapi-ec2-awsb65",
      "image": "242201281931.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/awsb65/fastapi:latest",
      "memory": 256,
      "cpu": 256,
      "essential": true,
      "environment": [
        {
          "name": "APP_NAME",
          "value": "AWSB65_DEMO_APP"
        }
      ],
      "portMappings": [
        {
          "containerPort": 80,
          "protocol": "tcp"
        }
      ],
      "logConfiguration": {
        "logDriver": "awslogs",
        "options": {
          "awslogs-group": "awslogs-b65-fastapi-ecs",   -->create an loggroup with this name in cloud watch.
          "awslogs-region": "us-east-1",
          "awslogs-stream-prefix": "fastapi-b65"
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "volumes": [],
  "networkMode": "bridge",
  "placementConstraints": [],
  "family": "fastapi-ec2-awsb65"
}


Note:
--------
*Same like Task Definitions in EKS we called "manifest".
*In task definitions whatever the containers we have even if someone stops the container it won't be start automatically.
*Task option in cluster is used to run container individually.
