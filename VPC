3.VPC Detail Creation.
----------------------------
Class 3:

1. What is Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)?
   VPC is a Logical Network Boundry which provides network isolation. Means Virtual machine since diffrent VPC's dont communicate among   each other.

Another cloud network services:
*Azure Virtual Network or VNET

*Google VPC

2.Create VPC and Linux machine in a more detail manner?

1.Create VPC with Address Space 10.65.0.0/16 -->Regional Resource.

Enable DNS Hostnames

2. Public-Subnet-1 10.65.1.0/24 us-east-1a

Public-Subnet-2 10.65.2.0/24 us-east-1b

Public-Subnet-3 10.65.3.0/24 us-east-1c

Enable Automatic Public IP Assignment.

3. Create a Internet Gateway and attach it to VPC.

4. Create a New Route Table and attach subnets. Also add 0.0.0.0/0 to IGW.

AWSB65-Public-Subnet-1 10.65.1.0/24

5.Deploy an Amazon Linux 3 machine.



Note:
*when create an subnet so the default route table will be created in subnet.
*if you enable the auto assign public ip for every subnet.so when you deploy a server it will asssign one public ip for your server.
*if you won't enable the DNS hostnames when you create an instance.it won't give public IPV4 DNS to your server.
*whenever you create an route table one default "local route" entry will bw added automatically in route table.It will allow communication only inside of vpc within diffferent subnets. 
*if you won't add subnets in subnet associations in route table.The request of your instance of that subnets will route the traffic to default route table.
