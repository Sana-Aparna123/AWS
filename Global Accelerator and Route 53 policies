Global Accelerator:
-----------------------

Route 53 Load Balancing:
------------------------

DNS Based Load Balancer, means we cannot select port and protocol.

No ip addresses are involved for route53.

Route53 Routing Policies:
--------------------------
  - Failover => One Primary Endpoint and One Secondary Endpoint.
  - Latency => Reach to nearest endpoint based on customer location.
  - Weighted => Control traffic based load-balancing weights.
  - Geolocation => Restrict tarffic based on country.
  - Geo-Proxuimity based on Lat and Long.
  - MultiValue.
  - CIDR Based.

Following is not possible with route53(Similar to Google Map) as its a DNS based LB
- Cannot have https and also redirection.
- Cannot have options to select protocol.
- Cannot select port number.

steps:
------
*create an vpc and install servers in three regions like us-east-1(N.Virginina),ap-south-1(Mumbai) and eu-west-1(Ireland) using terraform code.
Note:Us-server in Virginia region,India-server in Mumbai region and Ireland-server in Ireland region. 

*Go to route 53 and create different records for routing policies for three servers and access the domain names of their individual records.


1. Global Accelerator:
------------------------- 
*LB at a global level which will allow us to select port and protocol.

*Global Accelerator will give you two static ips after creating that one.we can use that ips anywhere throught world based on your requirement.

*Global Accelerator doesn't do SSL Termination.we cannot use SSL/TLS IN global acceleratpr.if you want use load balancers for every region and generate certificate for that and include that loadbalancers(EITHER NLB OR ALB). to global acceleartor.

*we can install the SSL/TLS certificate either in server level or load balancer level.-->to access the domain in https.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*connect to server us-east-1 server name is US-server
*sudo su -
*snap install certbot --classic
*certbot --nginx
*give your email address
*click yes two times
*it will ask domain name go to route 53 service create an record for your servers.
*give that domain name in certbot.

Note:Do this process for three servers like Us-server,India-server,and Ireland-server.
Steps:
------
*create an vpc and install servers in three regions like us-east-1(N.Virginina),ap-south-1(Mumbai) and eu-west-1(Ireland) using terraform code.
Note:Us-server in Virginia region,India-server in Mumbai region and Ireland-server in Ireland region. 

*Go to global accelerator service and create global accelerator.you can take ALB,NLB OR Ec2 servers in that.i used Ec2 server.

*Go to Route 53 service and create an simple routing record for global accelerator and access that domain using VPN from different location.(this will work for only http application)

*if you want to access domain using https.Follow the above process for each server.

*Access the domain using https for global accelerator.



process:
---------
*after all instances running in three regions

Global Accelerator service:
--------------------------
*click create accelerator
*provide name
*Acceleartor type-standard
*ip address type-Ipv4
*then next
*listeners-->ports:80,443 and protocol:TCP,client affinity:none
*then next
*add three endpoints groups-->1.Endpoint group 1-->region:us-east-1,traffic dial:100
                              2.Endpoint group 2--->region:ap-south-1,traffic dial:100
                              3.Endpoint group 3-->region:eu-west-1,traffic dial:100
                              
*then next
*Add Endpoint-->1.Endpoint 1-->Endpoint type-->Ec2 instance,Endpoint-->Us-server,weight:128
                2.Endpoint 2-->Endpoint type-->Ec2 instance,Endpoint-->India-server,weight:128
                3.Endpoint 3-->Endpoint type-->Ec2 instance,Endpoint-->Ireland-server,weight:128
                
*create accelerator
*after accelerator is created it will give two static ips.


Route 53:
---------
*Go to this service
*create an simple routing record for your domain-->name is global.awsaparna123.xyz
*record type--->A
*Value/Route traffic to-->Alias to Global Accelerator
*choose accelarator 
*click Define simple record
*click create record
*access the domain in web browser.(only http access)


*To access the domain in https use above process.
